# Flower_Recognition

This application uses different classification algorithms to predict the name of flowers simply by choosing an image file and click on the predict button. 

This also provides information on the accuracy with which the name of the flower is predicted.
The different types of classification algorithms used are Support Vector Machine and Convolutional Neural Networks.
With the advancement in technology, it has been possible to predict the name of the flower correctly using machine learning technique namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and deep learning technique namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

In our project, we implemented these algorithms to predict the classes of the flowers and applied various evaluation metrics on them for finding the best working algorithm. We have found that on using SVM, the accuracy is around 65-70% while CNN is yielding an accuracy of 80-90%.
